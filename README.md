# Exploring the Design Space of Artificial Life

## Description
This project is exploring the design space of xenobots created using an [evolutionary pipeline proposed by Kriegman et al](https://cdorgs.github.io/). The project aims to discover traits in the genotype-phenotype mapping that helps create a population of viable xenobot designs alongside analysing the effectiveness of compositional pattern producing networks as genetic encodings, and identifying why specific genotypes produce specific types of phenotypic structures.

Alongside exploring the design space of the original pipeline, this project aims to explore the genotype-phenotype relationship when other evolutionary algorithms are used to evolve the population of genotypes, such as HyperNEAT. The code uses [voxcraft-sim](https://github.com/voxcraft/voxcraft-sim) to assess the fitness of xenobots for perfoming given tasks, allowing for the evolution of a population.
